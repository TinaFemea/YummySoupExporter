YummySoupExporter
=================

Got lots of recipes in YummySoup that you'd like to export to another recipe program?  
This will allow you to export all recipes from your Library Database.sql to a folder full of .mx2 files.
Nearly every recipe app will import these files.

Known issues:  Unicode characters are removed.  The old Mastercook XML format does not support unicode.
